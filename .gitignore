# VAELIX | SENTINEL MARK I — EXCLUSION PROTOCOL
# ==============================================================================
# FILE:      .gitignore
# VERSION:   1.1.0 — Citadel Standard
# REPO:      citadel-s1-90-sentinel
# PURPOSE:   Prevents build artifacts and local system noise from polluting
#            the Source of Truth for the Sentinel Digital Twin.
#
# RULE:      If it is generated by a tool, it does not belong here.
#            If it is authored by an engineer, it belongs here.
#
# FIX LOG:
#   v1.1.0 — [CRITICAL] Removed .vscode/ipch/ — .vscode/ must NOT be ignored.
#             .vscode/settings.json and .vscode/extensions.json are hardened
#             Citadel project standards that must be committed.
#   v1.1.0 — [MODERATE] *.log scoped to test/*.log (blanket *.log too broad)
#   v1.1.0 — Added trailing slashes to directory entries
#   v1.1.0 — Added *.fst, *.fst.hier (forward-compatible with FST workflows)
#   v1.1.0 — Added *.swp (Vim/Neovim swap files)
# ==============================================================================

# --- PHASE I: SYSTEM NOISE ---------------------------------------------------
# OS-generated metadata and IDE state files.
# NOTE: .vscode/ is intentionally NOT ignored — it contains hardened
#       Citadel linting, formatting, and extension configuration that
#       must be committed and shared across all engineers.
.DS_Store
.idea
*.swp

# --- PHASE II: SIMULATION ARTIFACTS ------------------------------------------
# Waveform files are transient verification outputs — regenerated on every run.
*.vcd
*.fst
*.fst.hier

# Python/Cocotb compilation cache and test outputs.
test/__pycache__/
test/results.xml
test/sim_build/

# Scoped log files from simulation runs.
test/*.log

# --- PHASE III: SYNTHESIS OUTPUTS --------------------------------------------
# LibreLane run directories contain gigabytes of intermediate data.
# The GDSII output is accessed via GitHub Actions artifacts, not the repo.
runs/

# TinyTapeout submission packages are generated artifacts, not source.
tt_submission/

# Verilator build artifacts
obj_dir/

# --- PHASE IV: GENERATED NETLISTS --------------------------------------------
# The Gate-Level Netlist is produced by the GDS hardening action.
# It is injected into the test environment by CI — not committed to source.
# The Verilog source is the truth. The netlist is the echo.
test/gate_level_netlist.v

# --- PHASE V: LOCAL CONFIGURATION OVERRIDES ----------------------------------
# Machine-specific synthesis configs generated by tt_tool.py.
# These must never override the committed src/config.json Citadel standard.

src/config_merged.json
