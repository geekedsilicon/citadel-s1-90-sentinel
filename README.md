# VAELIX | SENTINEL MARK I
## THE "ZERO-DAY" CHALLENGE COIN
**"Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum."**

---

## 01 | THE ARTIFACT
The **Sentinel Mark I** is the physical manifestation of the Vaelix security philosophy. It is a functional 130nm ASIC designed not for computation, but for **Verification**. 

This chip serves as a hardware-level "Challenge Coin"—a sovereign token distributed only to TIER 1 partners. It carries a single, hardcoded cryptographic puzzle buried in the silicon logic. 

**Mission Status:**
* **Fabrication:** IHP 130nm SG13G2 (Tiny Tapeout 06 / IHP26a).
* **Function:** 8-Bit Hardware Authorization Gate.
* **Custody:** Vaelix Systems Engineering.

## 02 | THE LOGIC: "INDIVISIBLE"
Unlike software, which can be patched, the logic of the Sentinel Mark I is immutable. It is etched into the transistor mesh using **Citadel Primitives**.

* **The Lock:** A Finite State Machine (FSM) monitoring the 8-bit input bus.
* **The Key:** A specific 8-bit vector (`0xB6`) hardcoded into the gate layout.
* **The Response:** * **State A (Denied):** The 7-segment display shows a "Locked" pattern (`0xC7`). The chip remains silent.
    * **State B (Verified):** Upon correct key entry, the display shifts to "Verified" (`0xC1`) and the Status Array ignites.

### SECURITY: THE KAMKAR EQUALIZER
The authentication logic implements a **constant-time bitslicing comparator** to defend against power analysis attacks. Every authentication attempt performs exactly the same gate operations (8 XOR + 7 OR + 1 NOT), ensuring that power consumption reveals no information about the key. This eliminates Hamming Weight leakage and defeats side-channel attacks. See [KAMKAR_EQUALIZER.md](docs/KAMKAR_EQUALIZER.md) for technical details.

## 03 | OPERATIONAL INTERFACE
To verify custody of the Sentinel Mark I, the operator must interface with the **Vaelix Evaluation Terminal** (TT06 Demo Board).

### **Authorization Sequence**
1.  **Insert:** Place the Sentinel Coin into the socket.
2.  **Input:** Toggle the DIP switches to match the **Vaelix Key** (`10110110`).
3.  **Confirm:** Observe the telemetry. 
    * If the **"V"** (Verified) pattern appears, the token is authentic.
    * Any deviation results in immediate logic rejection.

> **Note:** The layout includes a microscopic **Vaelix Logo** etched onto the Metal 5 layer, visible only via electron microscopy, serving as a physical watermark of authenticity.

## 04 | FOUNDRY SPECIFICATIONS
**"The Luxury of Silence."**

| Parameter | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Foundry** | IHP (Innovations for High Performance Microelectronics) |
| **Node** | 130nm SG13G2 (BiCMOS) |
| **Clock Speed** | 25 MHz (Stability Optimized) |
| **Logic Density** | 65% (Fortified) |
| **Power Profile** | Passive / Event-Triggered |

## 05 | ENGINEERING LINEAGE
This chip is the direct descendant of the **Project Citadel** FPGA prototyping performed on the **Xilinx RFSoC 4x2** and **PYNQ-Z2**. It translates the "Brain" of the S1-90 into a tangible, holdable asset.

---

## 06 | PDK PRIMITIVE MAPPING
For accurate post-synthesis simulation and improved timing/area estimation, refer to the **PDK Primitive Mapping Guide**:
* **Detailed Documentation:** [docs/pdk_primitive_mapping.md](docs/pdk_primitive_mapping.md)
* **Quick Reference:** [docs/sg13g2_cell_reference.txt](docs/sg13g2_cell_reference.txt)
* **Techmap File:** [src/techmap_citadel_sg13g2.v](src/techmap_citadel_sg13g2.v)

These resources map our behavioral cells (from `src/cells.v`) to specific IHP SG13G2 standard cell instances, ensuring physical reality matches our logic intent.

## 06 | VERIFICATION & TELEMETRY ANALYSIS

The Sentinel Mark I includes a comprehensive verification suite powered by Cocotb. The **Telemetry Analyzer** automates post-test analysis and mission debrief generation.

### 🔬 Automated Mission Debrief

After running the test suite, generate a comprehensive analysis report:

```bash
cd test && make -B  # Run verification suite
cd ..
python analyze_telemetry.py --output MISSION_DEBRIEF.md
```

**Features:**
- 📊 Parse Cocotb test results (results.xml)
- ⏱️ Extract failure timestamps from waveform files
- 📝 Generate detailed Markdown reports
- 🔍 Automatic README.md integration

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# View report on console
python analyze_telemetry.py

# Save to file
python analyze_telemetry.py --output debrief.md

# Update README with results
python analyze_telemetry.py --update-readme
```

For complete documentation, see: [**docs/TELEMETRY_ANALYZER.md**](docs/TELEMETRY_ANALYZER.md)
